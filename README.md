# doc-as-code
_How to document code nowadays._

This project is **my** playground about software documentation. 

{:toc}

## Audience

Since I am native German, some content will be German.
My content is addressed to software developers.

## Product box

The product box shows in a few words the main purpose of the project.
Also for whom the product is and what requirements are necessary to use it.

### Purpose 

- If you plan to add new features to the product, you can look here to see if it fits at all.
  Sometimes it is better to develop a new product instead of adding more complexity to an existing one.
- If the project is new to you, you can tell at a glance from the product box what it does.
- A gorgeous product box can be used as a recognizable logo in listings.
